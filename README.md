Use a loop to prompt the administrator for the first and last
names of each of the 5 customers.
Combine the first and last names into a single string with a
space between them.
Validate that neither the first name nor the last name is empty. If
empty, re-prompt for that customer's name.
Finally display all the 5 customer names.
